## Jokes

If the mainframe was a learning center that Eric Cartman attended,
would you call it DBSkoo?

If the mainframe had RGB capabilities made by a certain company,
would you call it DBHue?

If the mainframe was a particular rodent known to have a robust skeletal
structure, so powerful in fact, you could step on it and it would survive unharmed,
would you call it the DB Hero Shrew?
